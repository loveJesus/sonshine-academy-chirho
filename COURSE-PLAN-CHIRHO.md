## Video Content Ideas (3D Game-Style Graphics)

Using AI video generation (Veo) + 3D tools:

1. **Intro Videos** - 3D character guide through code concepts
2. **Concept Animations** - Visualize how code works
3. **Challenge Introductions** - Epic quest-style intros
4. **Victory Celebrations** - Reward animations

Style: Clean 3D graphics, warm colors (amber/gold theme), Scripture integrated naturally

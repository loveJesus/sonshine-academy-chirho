## Video Content Ideas (3D Game-Style Graphics)

Using AI video generation (Veo) + 3D tools:

1. **Intro Videos** - 3D character guide through code concepts
2. **Concept Animations** - Visualize how code works
3. **Challenge Introductions** - Epic quest-style intros
4. **Victory Celebrations** - Reward animations

Style: Clean 3D graphics, warm colors (amber/gold theme), Scripture integrated naturally

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Fix inline code rendering (immediate)
2. [ ] Add syntax highlighting to admin quest editor
3. [ ] Implement quest pagination with scroll/trial grouping
4. [ ] Port CodePen workspace component
5. [ ] Design video intro template
6. [ ] Upload existing payloads to R2
7. [ ] Create course structure in database (modules, sessions, lessons)

## Questions to Discuss

1. Should we rename "Quests" throughout to "Scrolls" and "Trials"?
2. What video style do you envision - realistic 3D, stylized cartoon, or something else?
3. Should payloads auto-execute or require user action?
4. Do you want a "pathway" visual showing progress through the course?
5. Should the CodePen workspace support collaboration between students?
